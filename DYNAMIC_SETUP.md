# Dynamic Wallet Integration Setup

This project now uses Dynamic for wallet authentication instead of the previous MetaMask implementation.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Configuration Complete âœ…

Your Dynamic environment ID is already configured: `f07559ca-225a-4dba-b497-f71b210bf987`

### 2. Features

- **DynamicWidget**: A professional, pre-built wallet connection interface that supports multiple wallet types
- **Multiple Wallet Support**: Ethereum and Flow wallet connectors
- **Persistent Authentication**: Wallet connection state is maintained across app sessions
- **Automatic Redirect**: After successful wallet connection, users are automatically redirected to `/user-info`
- **Professional UI**: Dynamic provides a polished, user-friendly wallet connection experience

### 3. How It Works

1. The `AuthProvider` wraps the entire app and provides authentication context
2. The `DynamicWidget` in the SignUp component provides a professional wallet connection interface
3. On successful authentication, users are redirected to `http://localhost:8080/user-info`
4. Authentication state is persisted and available throughout the app via `useAuth()` hook

### 4. Usage

```tsx
import { useAuth } from '../contexts/AuthContext';

function MyComponent() {
  const { isAuthenticated, user, primaryWallet } = useAuth();
  
  if (isAuthenticated) {
    return <div>Connected: {user?.address}</div>;
  }
  
  return <div>Not connected</div>;
}
```

### 5. Supported Wallets

- **Ethereum**: MetaMask, WalletConnect, Coinbase Wallet, Rainbow, Trust Wallet, and more
- **Flow**: Blocto, Ledger, and other Flow-compatible wallets
- Dynamic automatically detects available wallets and provides the best connection experience

### 6. Components

- **AuthProvider**: Wraps the app and provides authentication context
- **DynamicWidget**: Professional wallet connection interface (replaces custom buttons)
- **useAuth Hook**: Access authentication state throughout the app

### 7. Troubleshooting

- The environment ID is already configured
- Check the browser console for any error messages
- Ensure your wallet extension is installed and unlocked
- For development, make sure you're using `http://localhost:8080` as specified in the redirect
- The DynamicWidget provides a better user experience than custom wallet buttons

### 8. Benefits of DynamicWidget

- **Professional UI**: Pre-built, polished interface
- **Better UX**: Handles edge cases and provides clear feedback
- **Maintained**: Regular updates and bug fixes from Dynamic team
- **Accessible**: Built with accessibility in mind
- **Responsive**: Works well on all device sizes
